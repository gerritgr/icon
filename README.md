Official Repo of the _icon: Fast Simulation of Epidemics on Coevolving Networks_ paper ((Arxiv))[https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04987].


In _coevolving_ (or _adaptive_, a special case of _temporal_ or _time-varying_) networks, the network structure evolves in response to the spreading dynamics and vice versa.


_icon_ allows you to simulate epidemic models on coevolving networks using rejection sampling. 
We extend the classical stochastic and continuous-time SIS (Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible) model by incorporating rules that allow for the association (creating an edge) of two unconnected susceptible nodes and the dissociation (removing an edge) of connected infected nodes.


# ‚öôÔ∏è Dynamics

The coevolving network and epidemic dynamics distinctly exhibit wave-like patterns:

# üìä Results

Our method scales much better with the size of the contact graph than the rejection-free baselines.
